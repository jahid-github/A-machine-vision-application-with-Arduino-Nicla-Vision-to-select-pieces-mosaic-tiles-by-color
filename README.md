# A-machine-vision-application-with-Arduino-Nicla-Vision-to-select-pieces-mosaic-tiles-by-color
Objective: Develop an application that can identify and select mosaic tiles of a specified color in real-time, using the Arduino Nicla Vision.
-Key Components:

Arduino Nicla Vision:
A compact board with an integrated camera and AI processing capabilities, perfect for vision-based tasks.

Actuation Mechanism:
A robotic arm, conveyor belt, or sorting mechanism to physically separate the selected tiles.

Color Analysis Algorithm:
Software that processes the captured images to identify tiles matching the target color.

Power Supply:
To power the Nicla Vision and any associated actuators.

-Optional External Components:

Light source for consistent illumination.
Display or interface for setting the target color dynamically.

-Workflow-
Image Capture: The Nicla Visionâ€™s camera captures frames of the mosaic tiles presented in front of it.
Preprocessing:

Convert the captured image to an appropriate color space (e.g., HSV, RGB).
Apply filters to enhance contrast and remove noise.

Color Detection:

Use thresholding or AI-based models (e.g., color segmentation) to identify tiles matching the specified color.
Compute bounding boxes for tiles that match the target color.
Selection:

Send control signals to the sorting mechanism to separate tiles of the identified color.
If no match is found, tiles continue along the default path.
Dynamic Adjustment (Optional):

Allow users to select or change the target color through an interface or physical buttons.

-Implementation Steps
Hardware Setup:

Mount the Nicla Vision on a frame to view the mosaic tile stream (e.g., a conveyor belt).
Connect actuators to the Nicla Vision through GPIO pins or additional control boards.
Software Development:

Use the Arduino IDE or a compatible development environment to program the Nicla Vision.
Leverage libraries such as OpenMV or TensorFlow Lite for image processing and AI.
Calibration:

Test and calibrate the system under various lighting conditions.
Tune the color detection thresholds or retrain the model as needed.
Integration:

Combine the Nicla Vision with the actuation system and test the end-to-end workflow.

-Challenges and Solutions
Lighting Conditions:
Ensure consistent lighting to avoid color detection errors. Use controlled light sources.

Processing Speed:
Optimize code for real-time performance by focusing on lightweight models or efficient algorithms.

Physical Constraints:
Ensure the tiles are well-separated and visible to avoid misclassification.

Applications
This system can be extended to:

Sorting tiles for creating color-specific patterns in mosaics.
Identifying and separating objects based on color in manufacturing.
Educational projects demonstrating machine vision capabilities.
