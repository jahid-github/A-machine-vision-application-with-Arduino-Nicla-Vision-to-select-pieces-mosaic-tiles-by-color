**Objective:**
Develop an application that can identify and select mosaic tiles of a specified color in real-time, using the Arduino Nicla Vision.

**Key Components**
1. Arduino Nicla Vision:
- A compact board with an integrated camera and AI processing capabilities, perfect for vision-based tasks.

2. Color Analysis Algorithm:
- Software that processes the captured images to identify tiles matching the target color.

3. Power Supply:
- To power the Nicla Vision and any associated actuators.

**Optional External Components**
* Light source for consistent illumination.
* Display or interface for setting the target color dynamically.

**Workflow**
1. Image Capture:
- The Nicla Visionâ€™s camera captures frames of the mosaic tiles presented in front of it.

2. Preprocessing:
- Convert the captured image to an appropriate color space (e.g., HSV, RGB).
- Apply filters to enhance contrast and remove noise.

3. Color Detection:
- Use thresholding to identify tiles matching the specified color.
- Compute bounding boxes for tiles that match the target color.

4. Selection:
- Send control signals to the sorting mechanism to separate tiles of the identified color.
- If no match is found, tiles continue along the default path.

5. Dynamic Adjustment (Optional):
- Allow users to select or change the target color through an interface or physical buttons.

**Implementation Steps**
1. Hardware Setup:
- Mount the Nicla Vision on a frame to view the mosaic tile stream.

2. Software Development:
- Use the Arduino IDE.
- Leverage libraries such as OpenMV.

3. Calibration:
- Test and calibrate the system under various lighting conditions.
- Tune the color detection thresholds.

4. Integration:
- Test the end-to-end workflow.

**Challenges and Solutions:**
1. Lighting Conditions:
- Ensure consistent lighting to avoid color detection errors. Use controlled light sources.

2. Processing Speed:
- Optimize code for real-time performance by focusing on lightweight models.

3. Physical Constraints:
- Ensure the tiles are well-separated and visible to avoid misclassification.

**Applications:**

*This system can be extended to:*
* Sorting tiles for creating color-specific patterns in mosaics.
* Identifying and separating objects based on color in manufacturing.
* Educational projects demonstrating machine vision capabilities.
